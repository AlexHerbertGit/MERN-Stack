# MERN-Stack

The prototype demonstrates the required website functionality for Assignment 1:

1. **Authentication:** Beneficiaries and Members can register, log in, and manage their accounts (via JWT).  
2. **Meals & Token Transactions:** Members list meals; beneficiaries browse meals and order them using tokens; members accept/reject orders.  
3. **Interactive Features:** Dashboards for both user types, token balances, order history, and real-time updates.
